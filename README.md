# ZXSheets: A Light, Powerful & Extensible Spreadsheet

## Architecture
### Related techniques
- TypeScript
- Browser Canvas2d API
- React
- Redux



### Layers

The project is seperated into 4 layers:

- **Core Layer**: Handles spreadsheet-related business, such as storage, query, calculation of formula, and so on. Besides, There is a `Driver Sublayer`, which provides instances for many interfaces for extending `Core Layer` and handling platform-specific business logics. It also provides a entry for `Plugin Layer` to inject code into `Core Layer`.
The final implementation is similar to IoC framework.

- **UI Layer**: Handles the operations related to spreadsheet drawing, including drawing on the computer screen (providing the user with a WYSIWYG view) and drawing on the printer. It also draws a user operation layer and emits user events to the `View Layer`.

- **View Layer**: Implemented in `React`, including Graphical User Interface, such as Ribbon, context menus, etc.

- **Plugin Layer**: Provides some peripheral modules, such as extended spreadsheet function in Javascript or Typescript, and injects drivers to `Core Layer`, changes the behaviour of three layer above.



## Running platform

- The desktop-end environment is Electron, which connects to the file system API provided by operating system and storage API provided by remote server.
- The browser environment runs in any modern browser and often connects to the server storage API. (It also works when using Browser File API to support local file editing, but is meaningless to do so, because of no OS file assosiation and other user-friendly support.)



## Desktop Support

- Windows >= 7

- macOS >= 10.11.6

- Linux platform able to run Chromium


### Browser support
All modern browsers, IE excluded.
